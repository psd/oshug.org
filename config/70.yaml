title:      Mentoring & Advocacy in Open Source + OSSG AGM
description: |
            <p>Whilst open source is now more widely accepted, there are still
            large parts of the engineering community who have yet to "see the
            light".  Advocacy remains a key role for all who care about open
            source, while mentoring helps user make best use of open source technology.</p>
            <p>This is a joint meeting with the <a href="https://ossg.bcs.org/">British Computer Society Open Source Specialist Group</a>.</p>

            <h3>FSF Europe</h3>
            <p id="fsfe">Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology.
            <br />
            Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is
            important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us.  Free Software
            gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software.  These
            rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and
            privacy.</p>

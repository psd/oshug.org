Notes on the site, because we'll no doubt forget all of this...

The site directory is the website, and contains two kinds of source files:

    site/index.yaml -- the site global data
    site/event/n.yaml  -- per-event data
    site/event/n.mp3 -- the event file

The templates directory contains templates to generate other site files:

    templates/index.xxx -- the site index template
    templates/event.xxx -- the per-event /event/ template
    templates/item.xxx -- a per-event file shared by the index and event
    ...

To build and deploy the site, make sure your local copy is fresh:

    $ git pull

Make local changes to the yaml or templates, then build the site:

    $ make

Test the site in your browser,

Then commit everything including the generated target files:

    $ git commit -m"blah blah blah" -a

Deployment is a matter of running:

    $ make deploy

Which ssh's to the site and checks out the top copy from GitHub
